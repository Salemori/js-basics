Difference between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages 

Dynamically typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking before run time. Hence the type of a variable is known/specified at compile time for statically typed languages which is not the case with dynamically typed languages.

Dynamically typed languages are more flexible and can save you time and space when writing scripts, 

Examples:
Statically typed languages: C, C++, Java, Scala, Rust, Go 
Dynamically typed languages: Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang,  Perl, Ruby

 Null It is the intentional absence of the value. It is assigned, and explicitly means nothing, an empty or non-existent value.
 
Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.
